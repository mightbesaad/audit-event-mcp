## What it does

- Records agent events (tool calls, decisions, human turns) to a per-client SQLite log with a SHA-256 hash chain — every record is cryptographically linked to the previous one
- Optionally notarises batches with a Merkle root + Ed25519 signature (paid tier) — external auditors can verify without contacting kajaril
- Exports all events for a data subject as NDJSON on demand (GDPR Art. 20 portability)
- Ships a Claude Code skill that runs 8 GDPR/AI-Act axes against any event store

## MCP endpoint

```
https://audit-event.kajaril.com/mcp
```

JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTPS, authenticated via Cloudflare Access (service token) or an OAuth
client-credentials access token — see [Authentication](#authentication). Contact
[studio@kajaril.com](mailto:studio@kajaril.com) for onboarding.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `record_event` | Write one audit event. Returns `{ id, chain_hash }`. |
| `verify_chain` | Recompute `chain_hash` for a range of events. Returns verified count and broken entries. |
| `query_events` | Filter by session, agent, event type, or date range. `input_hash` is never returned. |
| `export_dossier` | Export all events for a `subjectId` as NDJSON (GDPR Art. 20). Returns a 1-hour download URL. |
| `request_approval` | Ask a human to approve an action. Returns `approvalId`, an `approvalUrl` approve page, and your `webhookSecret`. Witnessed as `approval.requested` in the chain. |
| `check_approval` | Poll an approval: `pending \| approved \| denied \| timeout`, with reason and responder once decided. |

## Quick start

Record an event:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "record_event",
    "arguments": {
      "agentId": "travel-assistant",
      "eventType": "tool.call",
      "purpose": "User requested flight search via travel assistant",
      "sessionId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "input": { "tool": "search_flights", "origin": "LHR", "dest": "JFK" },
      "lawfulBasis": "contract",
      "subjectId": "user-8821"
    }
  }
}
```

Verify the chain:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/call",
  "params": { "name": "verify_chain", "arguments": { "limit": 100 } } }
```

Export a data subject's records:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 3, "method": "tools/call",
  "params": { "name": "export_dossier", "arguments": { "subjectId": "user-8821" } } }
```

## Authentication

Three ways in; all end at a signature-verified `client_id` that selects your tenant —
nothing user-supplied ever does.

**Cloudflare Access service token** (manual onboarding): send the token headers, CF Access
injects a verified JWT. Full surface.

**OAuth browser flow** (MCP clients, zero copy-paste): point your client at the server and
let it discover the rest —

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http audit-event https://audit-event.kajaril.com/mcp
```

RFC 8414 metadata advertises dynamic client registration (`/oauth/register`),
authorization with PKCE S256 (`/oauth/authorize`), and the shared token endpoint. Consent
is approved in the browser by a signed-in tenant operator; the granted scope (`agent` or
`admin`) is bound into the issued token.

**OAuth client-credentials (M2M)**: exchange a client secret for a 1-hour Bearer token at
`POST /oauth/token` (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, HTTP Basic or `client_id` /
`client_secret` body params):

```sh
curl -s https://audit-event.kajaril.com/oauth/token \
  -u "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d grant_type=client_credentials -d scope=agent
```

Two scopes, issued and rotated independently:

| Scope | May call |
|---|---|
| `agent` | `record_event`, `request_approval`, `check_approval` |
| `admin` | everything, plus `POST /credentials/rotate` |

Secrets are shown once at issue/rotation (`POST /credentials/rotate`, body `{"scope":"agent"}`)
and stored only as hashes in your tenant's Durable Object. Rotating a scope invalidates its
old secret immediately; outstanding access tokens expire within the hour.

The approval tools are also plain REST for production backends: `POST /approvals` (same body
as `request_approval`) and `GET /approvals/:id`, with `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`.

## How it works

### Hash chain

Every event commits to all events before it. The chain is recomputable from first principles:

```
input_hash_slot = input_hash ?? input_hash_omitted_reason
chain_hash      = SHA-256(id + "|" + event_type + "|" + input_hash_slot + "|" + prev_hash)
```

When a caller supplies `inputHashOmittedReason` instead of `input`, the reason string enters the chain — the omission itself is tamper-evident.

### Merkle notary (paid tier)

Every 15 minutes (or at 1,000 pending events), the notary Worker:

1. Collects `{ id, chain_hash }` pairs from pending records
2. Sorts them by id and builds a SHA-256 binary Merkle tree
3. Signs the root with Ed25519
4. Writes `merkle_root` + `notary_sig` back to each record

The notary public key is published at `/.well-known/notary-pubkey` (also proxied
same-origin on go.kajaril.com for the verify page). Any auditor can verify signatures
offline without contacting kajaril. The notary never receives `input_hash`, `payload_ref`,
or any payload content.

### Verifying a dossier

`export_dossier` returns a link to a human-readable dossier on **go.kajaril.com** with a
raw JSONL evidence file attached. Anyone can drop that file onto
**https://go.kajaril.com/verify** — the browser recomputes every record's chain
fingerprint from its exported preimage (`id | event_type | input_hash ?? omitted_reason |
prev_hash`) and checks each notary Ed25519 signature against the published key. Nothing is
uploaded; the verdict is computed client-side.

### Privacy design

- `input` is hashed locally; the raw value is not stored unless an R2 bucket is explicitly bound
- `input_hash` is excluded from `query_events` responses; dossiers export it (with
  `prev_hash`) as the chain preimage that makes independent verification possible — they
  are digests, never content
- `payload_ref` is never returned to callers — enforced at every handler boundary
- An empty `export_dossier` result (`eventCount: 0`) is valid GDPR evidence that no data exists for a subject

## Event types

```
tool.call | tool.result | decision.made |
human.turn | memory.read | memory.write | error.raised |
approval.requested | approval.decided
```

`approval.*` types are reserved: the witness records them itself when a human approval is
requested and decided. `record_event` refuses them — an agent must never be able to fabricate
human-decision evidence. (`approval.deferred` and `approval.escalated` are reserved for later.)

## Decision webhooks

When an approval carries a `callback_url`, the decision (approve/deny) is POSTed to it the
moment a human decides — this is what lets an interrupted agent resume instead of poll.
Timeouts never fire a webhook; polling resolves those.

Every delivery is signed. The body is JSON:

```json
{
  "type": "approval.decided",
  "approval": { "id": "…", "status": "approved", "reason": null, "responderId": "…",
                "agentId": "…", "sessionId": "…", "actionSummary": "…",
                "actionPayloadHash": "…", "createdAt": "…", "decidedAt": "…", "expiresAt": "…" },
  "chainEvent": { "id": "…", "chainHash": "…" }
}
```

`chainEvent` points at the `approval.decided` entry in the hash chain — cite it as evidence.

**Verifying the signature.** Your webhook secret (`whsec_…`) is returned in every
`request_approval` response as `webhookSecret` — no dashboard needed. Each delivery carries:

```
X-Kajaril-Signature: t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex>
```

To verify:

1. Read `t` and `v1` from the header. Reject if `|now − t|` exceeds 300 seconds.
2. Compute `HMAC-SHA256(key = the literal secret string (UTF-8, whsec_ prefix included),
   message = "{t}." + raw request body)`.
3. Hex-encode and compare to `v1` with a constant-time comparison.

```js
const expected = crypto.createHmac("sha256", secret).update(`${t}.${rawBody}`).digest("hex");
const ok = crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected), Buffer.from(v1));
```

The reference implementation is `verifyWebhookSignature` in `src/lib/webhook.ts` — the same
code path our tests run.

Self-hosting note: webhook signing derives per-tenant secrets from the `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`
Workers Secret. If it is unset, webhooks are not sent at all (never unsigned) and
`request_approval` returns `webhookSecret: null`; polling still works.

## Notification channels

`request_approval` accepts `channels: ["telegram", "email"]` and notifies the approver over a
ladder: instant first, email as the fallback.

**Telegram (instant).** Connect once — `POST /channels/telegram/connect` (admin scope) returns a
one-time `t.me` deep link (15-minute expiry). Open it, press Start, and approval cards arrive in
that chat with inline **Approve** / **Deny** / **Deny with reason** buttons. Deny-with-reason
prompts for a short reply that is recorded with the decision — stronger Art. 14 evidence than a
binary stamp. Connecting again replaces the bound chat.

**Email (fallback).** Set the approver address once — `POST /channels/email` (admin scope) with
`{"address": "…"}`. The email fires only when it is needed:

- immediately, if no instant channel delivered (not connected, send failed, or not requested);
- after 10 minutes, if an instant card was delivered but the approval is still undecided;
- never, if the approval would expire before the email could matter.

Mail is sent from `approvals@send.kajaril.com` with the decide link; replies reach a human via
`studio@kajaril.com`.

**Dispatch report.** Every `request_approval` response includes what actually happened:

```json
"notifications": { "telegram": "sent", "email": "scheduled" }
```

(`telegram`: `sent | failed | not_connected | unconfigured | not_requested`; `email`:
`immediate | scheduled | expires_first | no_address | unconfigured | arm_failed | not_requested`.)

TTL defaults follow the channels: 30 minutes when an instant channel is in play, 4 hours when
the request is email-only, explicit `ttlSeconds` always wins.

Self-hosting note: channels are optional. Without `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `RESEND_API_KEY` /
`CHANNELS_KV`, dispatch reports `unconfigured` and the approval still works through
`approvalUrl` + polling. The bindings are documented in `wrangler.jsonc` and `wrangler.go.jsonc`.

## Lawful basis (GDPR Art. 6)

```
legitimate_interest | contract | legal_obligation |
vital_interest | public_task | consent
```

Provide `lawfulBasis` for any event that processes personal data. Omit it for events that do not.

## Tiers

| Capability | Free | Paid |
|---|---|---|
| Hash-chained event writes | yes | yes |
| `verify_chain` | yes | yes |
| `export_dossier` (GDPR Art. 20) | yes | yes |
| R2 payload storage | optional | optional |
| Merkle root + Ed25519 notarisation | — | yes |
| compliance-audit axis 6 (notary coverage) | skipped | evaluated |

## compliance-audit skill

`skills/compliance-audit/SKILL.md` is a Claude Code skill that runs 8 GDPR/AI-Act compliance axes against any event store. Copy it into your workspace:

```sh
cp -r node_modules/@kajaril/audit-event-mcp/skills/compliance-audit .claude/skills/
```

Axes:

1. Lawful basis present — GDPR Art. 5–6
2. Purpose specificity — GDPR Art. 5(1)(b)
3. Subject linkage on `human.turn` events
4. Retention bounded (≤ 730 days)
5. Chain integrity — 10% sample recompute
6. Notary coverage ≥ 95% (paid tier only)
7. High-risk event completeness — AI Act Art. 12–13
8. Data minimisation signal — `payload_ref` fraction

Each axis produces `pass | fail | warn` with an evidence snippet. Output is JSON + a markdown summary block.

## Self-hosted deployment

### Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account with Workers and Durable Objects enabled
- `wrangler` CLI authenticated

### Steps

```sh
# 1. Create R2 bucket
wrangler r2 bucket create audit-payloads

# 2. Set notary signing key (paid tier)
wrangler secret put NOTARY_PRIVATE_KEY --config wrangler.notary.jsonc
# Value: hex-encoded Ed25519 private key — never committed to source

# 3. Deploy Workers
wrangler deploy
wrangler deploy --config wrangler.notary.jsonc

# 4. Add audit-event.kajaril.com as a CF Access Self-hosted Application
# Issue one service token per client with custom.client_id claim

# 5. Onboard a client
npx tsx src/scripts/onboard-client.ts --client-id acme-crm --tier free --region eu

# 6. Verify
curl https://audit-event.kajaril.com/health
```

Never run `wrangler deploy` from a dirty working tree. The deployed code must match git HEAD.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm test          # 81 tests (node:sqlite adapter, no cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers)
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
